### What is Data Structure?

Data Structures are the programmatic way of storing data so that data can be used efficiently. Almost every enterprise application uses various types of data structures in one or the other way. This repository will give you a great understanding on Data Structures needed to understand the complexity of enterprise level applications and need of algorithms, and data structures.

From the data structure point of view, following are some important categories of algorithms:

- <b>Search</b> − Algorithm to search an item in a data structure.
- <b>Sort</b> − Algorithm to sort items in a certain order.
- <b>Insert</b> − Algorithm to insert item in a data structure.
- <b>Update</b> − Algorithm to update an existing item in a data structure.
- <b>Delete</b> − Algorithm to delete an existing item from a data structure.

#### Why to Learn Data Structure and Algorithms?
As applications are getting complex and data rich, there are three common problems that applications face now-a-days.

- Data Search − Consider an inventory of 1 million(106) items of a store. If the application is to search an item, it has to search an item in 1 million(106) items every time slowing down the search. As data grows, search will become slower.
- Processor speed − Processor speed although being very high, falls limited if the data grows to billion records.
- Multiple requests − As thousands of users can search data simultaneously on a web server, even the fast server fails while searching the data.

To solve the above-mentioned problems, data structures come to rescue. Data can be organized in a data structure in such a way that all items may not be required to be searched, and the required data can be searched almost instantly.

#### Analysis of Algorithm

Efficiency of an algorithm can be analyzed at two different stages, before implementation and after implementation. They are the following −

- <b>A Priori Analysis</b> − This is a theoretical analysis of an algorithm. Efficiency of an algorithm is measured by assuming that all other factors, for example, processor speed, are constant and have no effect on the implementation.
- <b>A Posterior Analysis</b> − This is an empirical analysis of an algorithm. The selected algorithm is implemented using programming language. This is then executed on target computer machine. In this analysis, actual statistics like running time and space required, are collected.

#### Space Complexity
Space complexity of an algorithm represents the amount of memory space required by the algorithm in its life cycle. The space required by an algorithm is equal to the sum of the following two components −

- A fixed part that is a space required to store certain data and variables, that are independent of the size of the problem. For example, simple variables and constants used, program size, etc.
- A variable part is a space required by variables, whose size depends on the size of the problem. For example, dynamic memory allocation, recursion stack space, etc.

#### Time Complexity

Time complexity of an algorithm represents the amount of time required by the algorithm to run to completion. Time requirements can be defined as a numerical function T(n), where T(n) can be measured as the number of steps, provided each step consumes constant time.

For example, addition of two n-bit integers takes n steps. Consequently, the total computational time is T(n) = c ∗ n, where c is the time taken for the addition of two bits. Here, we observe that T(n) grows linearly as the input size increases.
