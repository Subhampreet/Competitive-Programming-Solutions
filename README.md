Each algorithm and data structure has its own separate README
with related explanations and links for further reading (including ones
to YouTube videos).

## Data Structures ‚è≥

A data structure is a particular way of organizing and storing data in a computer so that it can
be accessed and modified efficiently. More precisely, a data structure is a collection of data
values, the relationships among them, and the functions or operations that can be applied to
the data.

## Algorithms üßÆ

An algorithm is an unambiguous specification of how to solve a class of problems. It is
a set of rules that precisely define a sequence of operations.
