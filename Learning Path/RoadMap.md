 Treap.
f. Skip Lists.
e. Some self balanced Binary Search trees (e.g. Red Black Trees).
Brute force and it's tricks and advanced techniques (such as, pruning, bitmasks, meet in the middle, iterative deepining etc.)
Binary Search (not only the basic code).
Greedy.
Dynamic programming and it's tricks and optimisations (Knuth optimisation, convex hull optimisation, bitmasks, etc.).
Graph algorithms:
a. Traversal (DFS & BFS) algorithms and how to use them.
b. Finding Connected Components.
c. Flood Fill.
d. Topological Sorting (the famous algorithm uses DFS but you should also know Kahn's algorithm that uses BFS as it has much applications).
e. Bipartite Check.
d. Finding Strongly Connected Components.
f. Kruskal's and Prim's algorithms for finding the Minimum Spanning Tree of a graph and the variants of the problem.

h. Bellman-Ford's algorithm for solving the SSSP problem with negative sycles.
i. Floyd-Warshall's algorithm for solving the All Pairs Shortest Path (APSP) problem and it's variants.
j. Network Flow problem (all it's algorithms, variants and the problems reducable to it).
Mathematics:
a. You should be familiar with the BigInteger class in Java (maybe write your own if you are in love with C++).
b. Some Combinatorics.
c. Number Theory (all what you can learn about it).
d. Probability Theory.
e. Floyd-Cycle detection algorithm.
f. Game Theory (especially impartial games and Sprague-Grundy Theorem).
Strings:
a. Basic Manipulation.
b. Z-Algorithm for finding a pattern in a text.
c. Knuth-Morris-Pratt Algorithm for finding a pattern in a text.
