# You are given a list of n-1 integers and these integers are in the range of 1 to n. There are no duplicates in the list. One of the integers is missing in the list. Write an efficient code to find the missing integer.

# Input: arr[] = {1, 2, 4, 6, 3, 7, 8}
# Output: 5
# Explanation: The missing number from 1 to 8 is 5


# Approach: The length of the array is n-1. So the sum of all n elements, i.e sum of numbers from 1 to n can be calculated using the formula n*(n+1)/2. Now find the sum of all the elements in the array and subtract it from the sum of first n natural numbers, it will be the value of the missing element.
# Algorithm:
# 1. Calculate the sum of first n natural numbers as sumtotal= n*(n+1)/2
# 2. create a variable sum to store the sum of array elements.
# 3. Traverse the array from start to end.
# 4. Update the value of sum as sum = sum + array[i]
# 5. print the missing number as sumtotal â€“ sum

def getMissingNo(A):
    n = len(A)
    total = (n+1)*(n+2)/2
    sum_total = sum(A)
    return total - sum_total

A = [1, 2, 4, 5, 6] 
miss = getMissingNo(A) 
print(miss) 

# Time Complexity : O(n)
# Space Complexity : O(1)
